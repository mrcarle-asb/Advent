# Advent of Code solution

My code to find solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Implementation Methodology

To follow how the code was created these are the steps I've settled on:
1. capturing the input in `examples*.txt` and `input.txt`.
2. copy `part1.py` from the previous day just to bootstrap the imports and basic input code.
3. change the code until it works.
4. copy `part1.py` to `part2.py`.
5. change the code until it works.
6. commit all files unchanged from the moment I got the answer.

I feel like this will leave a good record of how I handled the change in requirements from part 1 to 2.
## How to Run

The solution for each day is in two parts (1 & 2) and requires python3 to be installed

in general they can be run with `./part1.py input.txt`

they generally print more than necessary but the answer is always on the final line.
